            <h4>Video Editing</h4>
            <p>Since I was in my junior high school I really like to do video editing because I get the chance to take something good and make it even better. The process of editing is what I enjoy most - putting pieces
              together and making sense out of them. I love editing. Its one of my favorite parts about film making. I feel that working with camera and editing it is actually my strong suit.
              Im a big fan of editing and keeping only the interesting bits in.

            <h4>Singing</h4>
            <p>Singing is one of my favorite because singing makes me happy. Every time I sing it brings joy to my heart and myself. Singers live to sing and their life is always circling around music.
              Words are not enough to explain how deeply singers are attached to singing and singing quotes are definitely ignite that fire inside them! God respects me when I work, but he love me when I sing.
              It is tale that you sing. As long as you believe it, it makes you powerful.
